(Intro)

(Http headers)

(Simple web request)

Look at DB query first

Caching:
Lots of solutions
Memcached, Redis, ElastiCache ( Amazon )
Check cache before reads
Fetch and write on misses

Simple code example
Just wrap a cache check around the database call

(web request with application caching)

Saved some time, took some load off the DB, but it's not all wins.

"Cache Invalidation"

Stale is ok sometimes:
My Profile vs Dave's Profile

Otherwise...

(Code)
Update the data, update the cache

sacrifice Freshness
- stale data is easy

sacrifice Complexity
- cache evicition can be tricky
- get all the places

read/write ratio matters
- more reads than writes is super-important

(Output Caching)
cache fully rendered content

(code)

quick cache check before render
version in key
- quick peek at data gives us freshness
could still cache at data layer
look at data or not

(output caching diagram)
saves render time
