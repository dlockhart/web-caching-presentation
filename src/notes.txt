DB query first

Lots of solutions, popular ones: Memcached, Redis, ElastiCache ( Amazon )
Check cache before reads
Fetch and write on misses

Simple code example
Just wrap a cache check around the database call

Saved some time, took some load off the DB, but it's not all wins.

"Cache Invalidation"

Maybe stale data is ok

Otherwise...

Update the data, update the cache
